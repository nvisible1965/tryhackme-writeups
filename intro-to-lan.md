## What is LAN?
 LAN generally stands for **L**ocal **A**rea **N**etwork. It means as it name refers it is network connection of local area(smaller areas like: schools,offices,library) which is often connected to switch/hub kind off devices.It does have different topologies(structure of devices connected in a network). It has mainly 3 topologies:
#### 1.Star Topology
#### 2.Bus Topology
#### 3.Ring Topology

---

## What is Star Topology
  In this topology, basically we have a centralised device(switch or hub) through which the data is being sent or recieved to other devices connected in the network.
  It can be costy, because of the cost of more cables and the device switch but it is also scalable and reliable.There is also one disadvantage that if there is any fault in centralised device
  then the whole network gets down.
