## ðŸ”Ž Room Overview
* It explains about OSI Model and it's 7 layers and their working and protocol.

## What is OSI Model?
  * **O**pen **S**ystem **I**nterconnection **M**odel.
  * It is a framework that how all the devices gonna sent, recieve and interpret(understand) the data.
  * **Encapsulation** = Adding of additional info to data header is known as encapsulation.

## Layer 1 - Physical
  * Lowest layer
  * Frames are put on this layer from data link in bianry form and will transmit in form of electrical signals if we use ethernet cables.
---
## Layer 2 - Data link
  * Physical Addressing (MAC address) of source and destination both.
  * Present the data in a format that is suitable for transmission.
  * Recieves packets from network layer with ip address added and add MAC address which is given by the manufacturer. Inside every computer NIC(network interface card) have unique mac adress to identify it.

## Layer 3 - Network
  * **Routing** = Choosing the best path for transmission of packet chunks.
  * *How the best path get selected?* There are mainly 2 protocols:
    * **1.OSPF(Open Shortest Path First)**
    * **2.RIP(Routing Information Protocol)**
    * Factors to decide which route is best are:
        * shortest
        * reliable(is any packet lost before on this path)
        * fastest physical connection (fibre or ethernet)  
  * It also do work of reassembly of packets means combining the data chunks/packets to see the full received data and vice-versa.

## Layer 4 - Transport
